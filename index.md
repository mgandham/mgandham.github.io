It's understandable to feel sadness and grief over a lost opportunity, especially when it involves someone you care deeply about. It's important to acknowledge and allow yourself to feel those emotions, rather than suppressing them. It's also important to remember that even if this particular relationship doesn't work out, there are still many possibilities for happiness and fulfillment in life. It's not helpful to compare yourself to a hypothetical future partner who may or may not exist, and to assume that they will be better than you in every way. Focus on being the best version of yourself and creating a fulfilling life, and trust that the right person will come along when the time is right

Imagine putting in  
all that time love and energy  
only to lose your best friend  

## 10/25/2022

That time we went into a stinky barn to look at guinea pigs  
Would have been happy to do that forever  
fawning over you fawning over them

Earsplitting ringing deafening  
silence following the thunderclap  
Roaring crashing crushing  
vacancy all around me  


Which hurts more? The dark  
Obscuring concealing supressing  
Or the blinding light of every day  
Revealing my world without you

ash-laden toxic fumes wafted from the cavern's mouth. A blackened creek dribbled over the stones, past the jagged teeth, and into the night. Steam was rising here, but also something else. A sickly scent of rot mixed with sweet nectar carried on the breeze. The howl of a wolf, coming up the road behind me, broke me from my spell.

Ahead of me the cave, jaws open, teeth receptive. My long-awaited entrance impending I knew I should be more afraid but I wasn't. I was done waiting, angry at myself for taking so long to get here, and furious with energy. I steeled my mind and unsheathed my sword with a spin that fired off sparks from my blade. Nothing would stop me and I'd get what I'd come for. I took a step forward with newfound determination.

Suddenly, the attack: Flying through the air, a soot-blackened wolfhound, madness shining in its eyes. Maw ajar, fangs reared. My neck: Present. Unable to feel the weight of impact as canines sink in, embed themselves in me. Blood jetting forth and out, drenching my resting place. Clenched fists. Harsh breathing. As I struggled with the clamped-down jaws on my neck I realized I simply didn't have the strength to continue. I accepted this reality in the split-second before my instantaneous death and awakening.

Bones. I snapped around and found myself scrambling in a nest of dead branches in a ditch alongside the path. The sticks were sharp, they stabbed me. A series of stalagmites threatening the edges of my existence hinted of eroded teeth that dragged my mind back to a scene from earlier. I reached down, feeling for the Earth, but the ground never came. Pointy spears and shards of dead wood slit my fingers and stabbed me as I reached for a an exposed root to escape. I tried to take a step but couldn't move. With rising, screaming panic I looked down to find that my body was just bones, dried out, hollow, and sickly with age. Cobwebbed skeletal carpaces with withering cartilage, clattering stupidly against each other, breaking down to nothing piece by piece

before me lay a sprawling network of black lines tattooed on the back of the visitor in the ink of long-dead polar squids. It was metallic and radiant with echoing tones of celestial blue and frozen black. He was completely anesthesized with the herb-root concoction produced by the willow tree, as was necessary for the magic to take effect. From my low vantage point, close to the Earth's surface, I could not make out the full scale and complexity of the patten tattooed on his back, nor its significance. I could only appreciate its material qualities: its look and homogeneity. I was content to wonder how it might smell or taste were I to extract it and distill it from the flesh of his back. Better yet, to be the one drawing it from the polar squids, battling them across the ice with razor-sharp ice axes until they were weakened, slain, and Essence proffered. I seperated my consciousness from the material plane and floated away, rising higher to get a better look

ferrites silent save for a faint high-pitched hum. Metalflies thriving on avoiding detection. Metalmice capable of producing cheesy squeaks but also adept at staying silent as they crept behind kitchen appliances. But the hummers pulsed with heavy vibes. I remember seekers, the electric hummingbirds in dead Central park. The depth and clarity at which they could resonate within a small space was astounding, as well as the levels of pitch and perfection they could attain while tuning in at finer frequencies. They were mystical and musical and mysterious. To see one was a very rare sight. Usually they were looking for loose cables to tap into

they were extremely sensitive to sound and could usually be found hanging out in the rafters of nightclubs and dancehalls across the city. Sometimes I'd find them perched on my window just resting, cleaning their antennae, and flapping their wings to the rhythm of my life

vibes.guide is up and I'm very happy to have an outlet for writing that is empty of any meaning or narrative. And yet how can I ignore the narrative that is real life? I got a Sharpie tattoo of a pirate skull and it has already fused into my being. I'm cooking spicy ass Thai food and now things are getting heated to the point where I can justify brewing Thai iced tea, and I am excited about my developing culinary skill set. I'm not ignoring my inherent tendencies but channeling them instead

The Rendering Core was a supercomputer more powerful than any artificial intelligence in existence and yet it wasn't a real object. The inner circuits of the Rendering Core lay deep within the mind of an Architect, accessible to him only while dreaming. Getting the Core up and running had not been an easy feat as the device required a massive amount of hypothetical processing power. Our Architect experimented with massive parallel computing systems at first but nothing was even theoretically close. Weeks passed. Massive installations, warehouses linked with one another across wide swathes of the continental mainland, computing facilities one after another as far as the eye could see, so wide a plane was needed to travel from one end of the Core to the other. Nothing worked. After a while the Architect was forced to admit that the amount of space needed for his creation to be realized was unfathomable. Unable to conceive the size and scale of his creation prevented him from being able to operate it, as vast portions would unexpectedly black out and his simulations would be crude and fragile

Then the fateful day arrived. He woke up, dredged himself from his heavy bedcovers, and made himself a hearty breakfast and a cup of fresh-ground coffee. He worked for a while on programming assignments (essentially neural networks) for his classes. He drank lots of water and didn't worry about his compute issues. Then he fell asleep for a mid-day nap

At once he found himself in the control room of the Rendering Core, which had been chiseled inside a familiar and instantly memorable place: the face of an immense monolith of granite, reduced to half by ancient glacial shearing. Not quite over the supervolcano but some ways Southwest from the caldera. His chief engineers were standing there, looking angry and depressed. Likely there had been more failed simulations. Their accusations were unspoken but clear: There wasn't enough processing power. The Architect ejected from the base and hurtled upwards, skyrocketing into the clouds. He stepped onto a floating platform, waiting for him at exactly the apex of his trajectory, where there awaited a landing pad for his personal spacecraft. It was one of those iconic X-shaped fighters from a popular film series. He had conjured it so many times that it was practically always waiting for him now. Seconds later he flew into orbit

The failures of the Rendering Core were beginning to seriously stress him out. After all he had invested practically all his wealth in the real-world (and that of others) into its development. Instinctively he began to meditate and looked out from the cockpit at the crude, low-resolution version of his home planet sprawling below him, a geosedic sphere of tesselated polygons in crummy patterns of green and blue. He blinked the geometry away for a moment and let his mind relax

The size and scale of the planet suddenly shifted into focus for him and he could see an almost-infinite grid sprawled across the mainland's neverending plateau: it was his latest iteration of the Rendering Core. Gazing at the immensity of his creation from this high up, seeing it all at once, something clicked. The resolution of the simulation increased again. He felt the computational load on the Core being lifted as frozen portions of the computer came back online. He knew what must be done for the next version of the machine

The next iteration of the Rendering Core wasn't based on the surface, as before. It was in orbit around the planet. Finally our Architect had conceived of a design so vast and immense that it had the power to render any simulation, and also the simplicity to be fully envisioned by his lucid consciousness while sleeping. Stacks and stacks of the latest top-of-the-line computer processors, loaded into shipping containers, were linked together by cables into Ring Units. The Ring Units were stacked against each other in zero-gravity forming a massive ring encircling the planet below. Spinning 24 hours a day, powered by it's own inertial motion, the Rendering Core was laboriously constructed with leviathan lifting ships that brought the storage containers into orbit. Teams of workers were brought into space to keep the facility running at all times. They lived and worked and existed in space, farming, going to school, and working in space industries. Regular shuttles to and from the surface kept morale up for everyone

simply the most amazing thing I've seen recently: Adult sperm whales rising from the depths to join their calves off the coast of the Azores islands of Portugal. The Azores are supposed to be an excellent destination for pelagic animal encounters, and diving with whales is possibly the top thing on my bucket list. It's only a matter of time!

this morning I woke up naturally at 8:30 am. The lights in my brain turned on and I felt well-rested, but part of me wanted to continue sleeping and avoid the commitments of the day ahead. I figured it was okay for me to sleep in longer since I was still a student with no real responsibilities. Content with this line of reasoning, I seamlessly drifted into a half-asleep state. In my mind's eye I found a neatly folded scrap of parchment. It was a message to myself, from me. I opened it. In caligraphy, it said: "Wake Up." I crumpled up the parchment and tossed it in the direction of a freshly manifested wastebasket. The crumpled paper ball bounced off a white brick wall and arced neatly into the bin. Bank shot

the train doors closed in my face just as I was about to board. A frenzy of energy exchanged frantically between me and the slack-jawed passengers on the other side of the doors. They had made it onto the train and were now pawing at the glass arbitrarily, as if the doors would magically open and permit entry to me and the woman standing next to me, caught in the same predicament. Everyone had panic in their eyes and pain in their souls for me and my new friend. The train left the station and suddenly there was a vast emptiness and silence. Chaos and confusion lingered but new emotions now surged forth to fill the space

"That's never happened to me before," I remarked wistfully. I wasn't necesarily speaking to her, just to myself as I tried to make sense of the landscape of minute trauma swirling around us. A brief and uncomfortable silence followed. "I'm sorry, I'm just so mad right now," she said. The resentment and anger seeping from her seams was unmistakable in the vacuum of the subway station. Above all else there was misery

I didn't say anything, just smiled because it was very understandable and I felt sorry for her. I cursed myself for not trying to push my way onto the train more aggressively when I had the chance

the best part of living in New York City is being swept into a frenzy of passion and activity no matter where you go. There's a sense of unity and joint purpose that drives everyone around you into taking another step forward. New York City has a well-established identity as "The City that Never Sleeps," and once you're here, you're adopted into that ethos. When I visited my sister in Washington D.C. she told me that she experienced a similar sense of unity with the average passer-by, a fact which she chalked up to the identity of D.C. as a city of political activists and leaders. Generalizations can empower people with a sense of purpose and camaraderie. Evoking a sense of identity is a good way to enagage users, and in constructing a platform for geo-local engagement I hope to do something useful for my country as a whole. I want people to feel connected to the places they live and accept and understand one another. Our perspectives are functions of our locales and upbringings and I want a platform that brings those relationships to the forefront of conversation. we are one

when confronted with tragic news, I feel it on the inside and don't know what to say or do on the outside. I don't know how to console or comfort someone in pain. Instead I cling to the hope that my internal anguish does something to make the world a better place. But obviously it doesn't. Getting older means we die. Internalizing emotions is not a sustainable solution to dealing with grief. Here are articles memorializing the recent passing of students at Columbia University: rest in peace

this is Manu. Years ago I dreamt that Earth was flooding over. I was trapped in a house with water rising rapidly around me. I stood on a desk and realized that everyone I ever knew and loved was dead. I thought this was the end. Searchlights appeared in the window and I was rescued by government agents. I was informed that humanity would survive this calamity by settling a new planet far, far away. To my utter bewilderment I was boarded onto the Ark: a massive spacecraft full of survivors ready to depart Earth. As the final countdown took place, the atmosphere aboard the ship was jubilant and euphoric. The Ark was evidently our home for the indefinite future, and everyone was ready to celebrate like college freshman, thankful for deliverance from reality and responsibility. I felt completely alienated from the joyous rabble. Amidst the roaring of thrusters I looked out a window and saw the surface of the planet below, dense with debris and waterlogged beyond recovery. It would have no meaning to anyone anymore, just a remnant from the past, something for the history books. Then, looking up from the watery wasteland, I saw something I will never forget: another Ark. So incredibly gargantuan but launching from so many miles away on Earth's surface that I could finally see the mysterious spacecraft in its entirety. It was an elongated rectangular obelisk, capped with pyramids on either end which tapered to singular points. I saw it pushing slowly into space as Earth fell behind. Somehow I knew that there was someone I loved aboard that ship. this was just the beginning
